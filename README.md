The R file in this repository contains a step by step guide for implementing Distributed Dictionary Representations. I highly recommend reading Garten and colleagues (2018; https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-017-0875-9) prior to using. 

The code uses the hash pagackage to look-up and average pre-trained glove embeddings for example documents. It then creates an example construct represenations using these same glove embeddings and calculates the coside similiarities between the document and construct embeddings. Please let me know if you spot any errors!
